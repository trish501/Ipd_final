# Urban Fire High-Resolution Satellite Pipeline

## 1. Objective
To automatically query and download scientific, high-resolution ($\leq20$m) optical satellite imagery that closely matches NASA FIRMS VIIRS/MODIS fire detections. The goal is to generate a pristine, unscaled, scientifically accurate visual dataset for analyzing urban buildings, structures, and fire/smoke environments.

## 2. NASA FIRMS Input
The pipeline automatically fetches VIIRS (375m) and MODIS (1km) FIRMS active-fire CSVs for a given date range. FIRMS provides reliable, high-frequency thermal anomaly data. It serves as the accurate spatial and temporal trigger for our pipeline. The pipeline dynamically extracts latitude, longitude, and computes a UTC datetime to anchor the satellite search.

## 3. Satellite Source
- **Sentinel-2 L2A**: 
  - Provider: Copernicus / ESA (via Microsoft Planetary Computer)
  - Native Resolution: 10m (RGB, NIR), 20m (SWIR, narrow NIR)
  - Output Analysis Grid: 10m (20m bands are aligned/resampled strictly where necessary)
  - RGB Bands: B04 (Red), B03 (Green), B02 (Blue)
  - SWIR Bands: B12 (Red), B11 (Green), B04 (Blue)
  - SWIR+NIR Bands: B12 (Red), B8A (Green), B04 (Blue)
  - Access: Free STAC
  - Coverage: Global

*Note: Landsat is explicitly excluded because its 30m resolution fails our strict $\leq20$m native resolution requirement. Other satellites like NAIP are excluded to maintain global consistency.*

## 4. Scene Selection & Temporal Matching
Time difference is the single most important factor. Fire and smoke conditions change in minutes. The pipeline enforces a strict **$\pm$ 3-day search window** from the FIRMS detection time and ranks valid scenes strictly by the **minimum absolute temporal difference**.

## 5. Cloud & Geometry Filtering
1. Scenes exceeding the strict cloud cover threshold (default **30%**) are rejected. 
2. The pipeline geometrically intersects the STAC footprint to guarantee the FIRMS coordinate is physically contained within the raster asset, ignoring scenes that merely graze the search bounding box.

## 6. Image Processing & Scientific Integrity
Crops are exactly centered on the FIRMS point based on a fixed **2km $\times$ 2km** bounding box, resulting in a consistent `200 x 200` pixel output at 10m spatial resolution.

**CRITICAL:** The pipeline strictly preserves native `uint16` BOA (Bottom of Atmosphere) reflectance values. 
- No artificial sharpening.
- No gamma correction.
- No contrast stretching or histogram equalization.
- No fabricated pixels or synthetic ML inference (no YOLO, no fire classification).

## 7. Why Fire/Smoke May Not Be Visible
FIRMS thermal detection does not guarantee optical visibility of flames or smoke due to obscuration, extremely small active fire fronts, rapid extinguishing, or orbital offset. The dataset contains satellite imagery *associated* with FIRMS events; it is **NOT** automatically verified visual fire ground truth.

## 8. Installation
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 9. Usage
The pipeline features an interactive CLI. Run the orchestrator:
```bash
python main.py --max_workers 5
```
You will be prompted to select the data source (VIIRS/MODIS), geographic location (World, Country, Custom bbox), date range, and target image count.

## 10. Output Structure
The generated dataset is managed under `dataset/`:
- `dataset/unreviewed/events/event_XXXXXX/`: Event-specific directory containing:
  - `aligned_10m/`: Raw `uint16` TIFF exports (B02, B03, B04, B08, B8A, B11, B12).
  - `rgb/`: `B4-B3-B2.jpg` visual composite.
  - `swir/`: `B12-B11-B4.jpg` visual composite.
  - `swir_nir/`: `B12-B8A-B4.jpg` visual composite.
  - `metadata.json`: Exact geometric and temporal event metadata.
- `dataset/metadata/events.csv`: Master registry of successful event generation.
- `dataset/cache/`: Resumable internal state and deterministic cache to survive network interrupts.

## 11. Troubleshooting
- `Raster read error`: Usually due to STAC asset access latency or Planetary Computer rate limits. The pipeline implements exponential backoff to recover automatically.
- `ModuleNotFoundError`: Ensure your virtual environment (`.venv`) is activated.
